        h1 New Workspace Item Variants 
        p A new workspace is required to manage the item variants and their BOMs. These item variants in this new workspace will refer to the given base item to allow for data reuse by using derived fields, but will also have additional fields that define a variant (i.e. color, material, dimeions, serial #, ...). Customers can choose any properties they like for these variant specific properties, the application will adjust accordingly.

        p With the default configuration, the application will reuse the default BOM view used by other applications as well: 
            strong Tree Navigator
            |. If you prefer to use another BOM view or cannot use this default BOM view, you can also specify another BOM view name in the server setting
        p.code 
            span variants.workspaceItems.bomViewName    
        p While this BOM view may also contain further columns without impacting the Variant Manager, the performance of the editor will be better the less columns are contained in this BOM view.
        h1 Starting the application
        p Users should be able to launch the 
            strong Variant Manager 
            |from any item of workspace 
            strong Items

            strong Chrome Extension 
            |that is provided with this UX package and which can be used in Mircrosoft Edge and Goolge Chrome. Click the following button to learn about the installation of this extension. Once this Chrome Extension is installed, the given button will automatically be displayed in the header of each item and you can proceed with the next chapter.

        br
        br
        p If you cannot / don't want to use this extension, you will instead have to add a computed field in the 
            strong Item Details 
            |page which renders the given button. This also requires a field to store the dmsID in a hidden field.

        p Enable access to the

            | by adding a new computed field to your 
            strong Items 
            | workspace. Use the following formula for the new field: 
        p.code '&lt;a style="border: 1px solid #bec8d2;border-radius:3px;color: #0a131c;font-weight:600;line-height:32px;padding:4px 20px;text-align:center;text-decoration:none !important;white-space:nowrap;" target="_blank" href ="LOCATIONvariants?wsId=57&dmsId='||DMS_ID||'"&gt;Variant Manager&lt;/a&gt;'
        
        h1 Optional: Integrate With Products Workspace
        p Instead of starting the Variant Manager from an item, you can also start it from a product. In this case, the product's 
            strong Engineering BOM 
            |will be used as a basis and all variants will be stored within the product's list of variants (the grid tab). Perform the following steps to enable this integrated feature.
        h2 Adjust Grid tab of workspace Products
        p Add a column BOM to the grid based on a pick list for workspace Item Variants:

            |of workspace 
            strong Products 
            |to locate the matching item. If this field does not exist, you will have to update the given button's configuration in settings.js. Click the following button to learn about the installation and configuration of this extension.
