        h1 Important - Read before proceeding
        p This editor helps in transitioning an Engineering BOM to a Manufacturing BOM. This may involve one or two item workspaces, depending on your tenant configuration and preference. If your tenant has been created before Mid 2023, your tenant will most likelly have two workspaces to manage items: 
            strong Items and BOMs 
            |as well as 
            strong Vault Items and BOMs
            |. If your tenant is more recent, it will only contain the new workspace named 
            strong Items 
            |(unless you installed the Vault Items and BOMs from the template library).
        p If your tenant only has the single 
            strong Items 
            |workspace, this workspace will be used to manage both the EBOMs and the MBOMs. In this case, all installation steps referring to both EBOM and MBOM must be applied to this workspace. You can skip all steps referring to the 
            strong 2 Workspaces 
            |setup.
        p On the other hand, if you have two workspaces, you can use the one for the EBOM and the other one for the MBOM. In this case, you will most likely use 
            strong Vault Items and BOMs 
            |as the EBOM workspace and 
            strong Items and BOMs 
            |as the MBOM workspace. This setup is referred to as the 
            strong 2 Workspaces 
            |setup in the instructions below. Of course, you can also choose one of these workpaces and use it for both EBOM and MBOM at the same time.
        p Note that the viewer inside the MBOM Editor will only work if the base EBOM item has a dwf file attached.

        h2 Adjust Item Details
        p Make sure that the NUMBER field of your MBOM workspace is editable (always or at item creation).
        h2 Extend Item Details
        p If you use the same workspace for both the EBOM and MBOM, simply add the following fields to this EBOM &amp; MBOM workspace. You may add these fields to the matrix created before:
        ol 
            li Add field EBOM as linking pick list to the EBOM workspace (EBOM, Single Selection, editable)
            li Add checkbox 'Is Process' (IS_PROCESS, hidden, editable)
        p If instead you will use two different workspaces (i.e. manage the EBOM in 
            strong Vault Items and BOMs 
            | and the MBOM in 
            strong Items and BOMs 
            | workspace), you also have to add the following fields to the MBOM workspace in addition: 
        ol 
            li If it does not exist yet, add Single Line Text field 'DMS_ID' (DMS_ID, length 20, not editable, hidden)
            li Add date field  'Last MBOM Sync' (LAST_MBOM_SYNC, visible, editable)
            li Add Single Line Text field 'Process Code' (PROCESS_CODE, length 10, visible, editable)
            li Add computed field 'MBOM_EDITOR' with the following formula. Make sure to provide the right workspace ID (...?wsId=57...). It has to match the MBOM workspace ID (57 matches the standard Items workspace).

        h2 Add new fields to Bill of Materials tab
        p Add two new fields to the Bill of Materials tab in your MBOM workspace. These fields will be required for the next step and added to the given BOM view.
        ul

        h2 BOM View
        p If you use the same workspace for both the EBOM and MBOM, add the following fields to the existing BOM view 
            strong MBOM Transition
            |:
        ol 
            li EBOM 
            li Is Process
            li Is EBOM Item 
            li EBOM Root Item
        p If instead you will use two different workspaces, you have to add a new BOM view 
            strong MBOM Transition 
            |with at least the following columnns:
        ol  
            li EBOM

            li EBOM Root Item
        h1 Additional step for 2 workspaces setup 
        p Make sure that the MBOM workspace allows for BOM connections to the EBOM workspace:
        img.border(src='images/apps/mbom-editor-4.jpg' style='width:100%;max-width:900px;')
        h1 Scripts
        p For both the EBOM and MBOM workspace, the system has to store the dmsID for new records in field DMS_ID. Add the following script code to the creation event of both workspaces. If your tenant is based on the template released in April 2023, this field exists in your tenant and will be set by script already.
        p.code
            span item.DMS_ID = dmsID;
        h1 Default Values for new items 
        p When users add operations and MBOM items, these new items may receive default values for defined fields, like a specific type. Such defaults can be defined in the file settings.js - see next chapter for details. The default settings file provides a placeholder example:
        img.border(src='images/apps/mbom-editor-9.png' style='width:100%;max-width:725px;')
        p You can provide an array of all the fields to be populated with default values. As shown in the example above, this requires the field's ID (TYPE) and value. In addition, the setting 
            strong fieldsToCopy 
            |enables definition of a list of fields which will be copied from the given related EBOM item to the new MBOM item.
        h1 Server Settings File
        p Review the following contents in file 
            strong settings.js
            |. The default configuration matches the standard tenant template and makes use of the 
            strong Items 
            | workspace only. If you change this file, a restart of your server is required.
        p.code  
            span export.config = {
            span.indent 'mbom' : {
            span.indent-2 'wsIdEBOM' : '57',
            span.indent-2 'wsIdMBOM' : '57',

        h2 Viewer Part Number Mapping
        p The MBOM Editor will load the selected EBOM item's viewable in the viewer and allow for interactions between the BOMs and the viewer. However, this requires a mappging of your item numbers and the property within the dwf which holds the item number as well. 
        p For a proper match, see the 'viewer' parameters at the end of settings.js. Provide the field ID of your Number field in EBOM workspace as 'fieldIdPartNumber'. Additionally, provide a list of possible property names in 'partNumberProperties' that might be present in your dwf files and contain the matching number too - the first occurence will be taken into account.
        p.code  
            span export.config = {
            span.indent 'viewer' : {
            span.indent-2 'fieldIdPartNumber' : 'NUMBER'
            span.indent-2 'partNumberProperties' : ['Part Number', 'Name', 'label', 'Artikelnummer', 'Bauteilnummer'],
            span.indent-2 'backgroundColor' : 255,
            span.indent-2 'groundReflection' : false,
            span.indent-2 'groundShadow' : true
            span.indent-2 ...
            span.indent }
            span }  
        h1 Support for multiple sites
        p With the standard configuration steps above, there will be only one MBOM per EBOM. However, the setup can be changed to support multiple MBOMs, for example to have site specific MBOMs. To achieve this setup, the fields that were created formerly must be cloned for each site.
        p By following the steps below, the existing fields will be kept in order to have a 'standard' base MBOM. In addition, further fields will be added to capture the MBOM for 'Site 1' and 'Site 2'. 
            br
            |Each site requires a unique id that you can define yourself. This id must be used to name the new fields and it will be passed to the MBOM editor to define the site context. In this setup, 'G' will be used for the generic MBOM while '1' and '2' are used for the site specific MBOMs. Keep in mind that these suffixes will get appended to all site specific MBOM item numbers.
        ol 
            li In the EBOM workspace, adjust the layout of the MBOM transition section as shown below, by adding a second matrixes to hold all the site specific contents: 
                img.border(src='images/apps/mbom-editor-6.png' style='max-width:1470px;')
            li Create new fields for the 2nd matrix. You have to create the same fields multiple times, one for each site. Always append the site index (G, 1, 2) to each field while keeping the field base name identical. Here are the fields for the Generic MBOM:
                ul 
                    li MBOM_G: Linking picklist to MBOM item workspace (single selection, editable)
                    li LAST_MBOM_SYNC_G: Date field (editable)
                    li LAST_MBOM_USER_G: Single Line Text (length 100, editable)
                    li MBOM_EDITOR_G: Computed field with the following formula. Note that the URL contains a parameter to identify the site (G)
                p.code CASE 
                    span WHEN (DMS_ID is null) THEN '<span style="white-space:nowrap;color:#bbb;font-style:italic;">Item ID is not set</span>'
                    span WHEN (END_ITEM = true) THEN '<span style="white-space:nowrap;color:#bbb;font-style:italic;">Not available for end items</span>'
                    span WHEN (MATCHES_MBOM = true) THEN '<span style="white-space:nowrap;color:#bbb;font-style:italic;">EBOM matches MBOM</span>'
                    span ELSE '&lt;a style="color: #0a131c;border: 1px solid #bec8d2;border-radius:3px;text-align:center;text-decoration:none !important;line-height:32px;white-space:nowrap;padding:4px 20px;width:140px;font-weight:600;" target="_blank" href ="LOCATIONmbom?wsId=57&dmsId='||DMS_ID||'&options=site:G"&gt;Edit MBOM&lt;/a&gt;'
                    span END   
                p Repeat these steps for site 1 and 2 accordingly. 
            li If you followed the setup instructions for a single MBOM before, remove the following fields as they are no longer required:
                ul  
                    li MBOM 
                    li Last MBOM Sync 
                    li Last MBOM User
                    li MBOM Editor
            li In the end, the MBOM section should look like this: 
                img.border(src='images/apps/mbom-editor-5.png' style='max-width:1470px;')
                p Note that you can choose other field labels of course. This documentation only reuses the field ID to better describe the setup process.           
            li In the EBOM workspace's BOM view 
                strong MBOM Transition 
                |add the following columns:    
                ul 
                    li MBOM_G
                    li MBOM_1
                    li MBOM_2 
                img.border(src='images/apps/mbom-editor-7.png' style='max-width:1080px;')
                p Note that your bom view might be named differently. Check for the name in use by validating setting mbom.bomViewNameEBOM in settings.js
        p Users are now able to open the editor for a specific site. Each site will receive a specific MBOM with a dedicated part number (the site suffix gets appended at the end):
