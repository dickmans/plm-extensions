            ul
                li Change Requests
                li Change Orders
                li Change Tasks

        p You can access the process dashboard with the 
            strong /dashboard
            |  endpoint by providing the workspace profile to use. The value of parameter wsId has to match the wsId property value of the configuration profile to use. If you're connected to a default tenant of 2023 or later, you can use these links:
        div(style='display:flex;gap:10px;') 
            a(href='dashboard?wsId=82' target='_blank') Problem Reporting Dashboard (wsId 82)
            a(href='dashboard?wsId=98' target='_blank') Non Conformances Dashboard (wsId 98)
        p You can also omit the workspaceId and select from the list of configured profiles instead:
        a(href='dashboard?' target='_blank') Process Dashboard Profiles
