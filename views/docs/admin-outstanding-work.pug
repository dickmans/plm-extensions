        h1 Important 
        p This utility makes use of impersonation to get the outstanding work lists of other users. This requires a 2-legged-authentication with an APS application based on Client ID and Client Secret. As this weakenes the security, it is recommended to proivde the additional settings required by this utility only if it is going to be used. You may want to use this utility witih a local instance of the UX server only to not have the Client Secret stored on a server being accessible globally.
        p To enable this utility, you must create an additional APS application of type 
            strong Traditional Web App
            |, providing a Client ID and a Client Secret. The given Client ID must be whitelisted in your tenant. Next, provide the ID and the Secret in your environment file in variables 
            strong adminClientId 
            |and 
            strong adminClientSecret
            |. Do not change the standard Client ID being used by the other applications.
        img(src='images/apps/users-1.png' style='max-width:960px;')
        p If these two setting are left blank, the UX server will work anyway and you can use all utilities except for the 
            strong User Settings Manager 
            |.
