                strong Items 
                | workspace and its standard properties.
            li If the Service Portal should (also) be launched from the Fusion Manage standard user interface, the Chrome Exteionns provided with this package must be installed.
            li Spare parts get identified by the standard field 
                strong Spare Wear Part 
                | of workspace 
                strong Items

                | or 
                strong Wear Part 
                | for an item, it will be treated as spare part in this portal. The list of valid values can be configured in the settings.js file.
            li If the portal is opened in context of a Product or Asset having a related Service BOM defined, this Service BOM will be used instead.
            li In order to create and manage the 
                strong Spare Part Requests 
                | processes, the given workspace is required in your tenant. Recent demo and trial tenants include this workspace already. If the workspace does not exist, you can follow the steps described further down below for a basic configuration of this workspace - or download the Spare Parts Requests template from the library. In the latter case, make sure that the request's details tab and grid entries can link to your Items workspace in the given fields.
        p If Spare Parts Requests are used, users will be able to track and update these requests within the Service Portal as well:

        h1 Modes
        p The Service Portal can be opened in different modes, it will automatically adapt to the given use case. 
        h2 Mode #1 : In context of an Item defined by wsId/dmsId
        p When opening the portal with URL parameters wsId and dmsId pointing to an item record, the portal will retrieve the EBOM of the given item and display its structure. Service technicians can navigate through the BOM, select spare parts and create Spare Parts Requests or Problem Reports in context of the selected item. In this scenario, Spare Parts are determined by the defined property on the EBOM items.
        p See below the example layout of 
            span.code http://localhost:8080/service?wsId=57&amp;dmsId=14669 
        img(src='images/apps/services-portal-10.png' style='max-width:640px;')
        a(href='service?wsId=57&dmsId=14669' target='_blank')
        h2 Mode #2 : In context of an Item defined by Part Number
        p Note that the same can be achieved by passing the URL parameter 
            span.code number 
            |followed by an item part number. In this case, the system will retreive the matching item first before then opening the related item's EBOM and viewable.
        p See belw the example layout of 
            span.code http://localhost:8080/service?number=002771 
        img(src='images/apps/services-portal-11.png' style='max-width:640px;')
        a(href='service?number=002771' target='_blank')
        h2 Mode #3 : Product Browser 
        p If no wsId and dmsId are provided, the portal will open a landing page showing a catalog of serviceable products. Users can navigate through this catalog, select a product of interest and open its BOM to create Spare Parts Requests or Problem Reports in context of the selected product. The list of products being shown in the landing page can be configured using settings.js. The Spare Parts will be determined by the Product's Service BOM if available - if not, the related EBOM and the defined Spare Part flag attribute will be used.
        p See below the example layout of 
            span.code http://localhost:8080/service 
        img(src='images/apps/services-portal-12.png' style='max-width:640px;')
        a(href='service' target='_blank')
        h2 Mode #4 : Asset Browser
        p If no wsId and dmsId are provided and the URL parameter 
            span.code &amp;type=assets 
            |is contained instead, the portal will open a landing page showing an Asset browser as well as assigned Asset Service Tickets. Users can open such a service ticket or an asset directly. In both cases, the asset's Service BOM or Engieering BOM will be used for the viewer, BOM and Spare Parts list generation. This mode requires the installation of the given template from the library for the Asset management.
        p See below the example layout of 
            span.code http://localhost:8080/service?type=assets 
        img(src='images/apps/services-portal-13.png' style='max-width:640px;')
        a(href='service?type=assets' target='_blank')
        h1 Add New Workspace Spare Parts Requests
        p The Service Portal can be used to initiate Spare Parts Requests processes with reference to the currently selected spare parts. However, this feature requires the given workspace to manage these requests. If you do not want to manage these requests in PLM or if this workspace is availalbe in your tenant already, please skip this chapter. 
        p If the workspace does not exist, you can follow the steps below for a basic configuration of this workspace - or download the Spare Parts Requests template from the library. In the latter case, make sure that the request's details tab and grid entries can link to your Items workspace in the given fields.
        h2 Add Workspace
        p Add a new workspace named 
            strong Spare Parts Requests 
            | using the settings shown in the following screenshot:

        h2 Item Details Tab
        p Add the following fields to the new workspace. You may add further fields (non-mandatory) and sections when needed. You may also omit 'Requestor' in all the field labels, they are just used to keep the internal Field ID identical to the label to make the setup easier.
