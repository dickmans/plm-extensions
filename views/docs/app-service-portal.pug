        h1 Prerequisites
        ul
            li This solution is based on the standard 
                strong Items 
                | workspace and its standard properties.
            li Spare parts get identified by the standard field 
                strong Spare Wear Part 
                | of workspace 
                strong Items
                |. If this property's value is set to 
                strong Spare Part 
                | or 
                strong Wear Part 
                | for an item, it will be treated as spare part in this portal.
            li In order to create and manage the 
                strong Spare Part Requests 
                | processes, you have to add the given workspace to your tenant as described below.
        h1 Limitations 
        p Note that there is no capability to track the progress of 
            strong Spare Part Requests 
            | in this application. The given button 
            strong Pending Requests 
            | has no function. Tracking of requests in only possible in the standard user interface of PLM for now. This might change in future releases of this application.
            br
            | The application indicates the stock availability of each spare part using colors. As this solution does not have a real time connection to an ERP, the given information is generated randomly.
        h1 Create BOM View 'Service' for workspace Items
        p Create a new BOM view 
            strong Service 
            | for workspace 
            strong Items 
            |and add at least the columns shown below. The sequence of columns does not matter. You may add further fields if needed, but this may impact performance / load times of the portal.

        h1 Add button to launch the portal 
        p Users can access the service portal by passing the dmsId and wsId of a given record, allowing to encode this information in a qr-code for example (see the end of this page for the given URL). 
            br
            |In addition, you may want to provide a button within the details page of an item to open the given portal from there. For this, add a new field 
            strong Actions 
            | which contains the computed formula shown below. In case your tenant has the given field already, please add this button to the existing 
            strong Actions 
            | field.
        p Note that this computed field requires the field 
            strong DMS_ID 
            | which must contain the dmsId of the current record. As the other solutions of this package require this field as well, it is assumed that the given field exists already. If not, please add the field as single line text and let it be set upon item creation.
        p Keep in mind to update the workspace id contained in the formula below if needed. It refers to workspace ID 57 which matches the standard 
            strong Items 
            | workspace. If you are using another id, please adjust the value of parameter wsId.

        h1 Create Workspace Spare Parts Requests
        p The following steps are optional. Your Service Portal should be ready by now. However, if you want to initiate requests for selected spare parts from within the portal, then continue with the steps of this chapter.
        h2 Add Workspace
        p Users can trigger requests for spare parts in the given portal. This is made possible with a new workspace named 
            strong Spare Parts Requests
