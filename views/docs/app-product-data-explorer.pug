        h1 Prerequisites
        p This app works best with the 
            strong Items 
            | workspace, but can also be used with the former 
            strong Items and BOMs 
            | workspaces. It is recommended to be used with a workspace where the items have viewable files (dwf) attached.
        h1 Features
        ul  
            li Navigate and visualize BOM of a given item
            li Browse to item of interest from a landing page
            li Filter BOM and 3D view by text and dynamic KPIs
            li Apply colours to BOM and viewer to visualise KPIs
            li Toggle BOM structure and flat table mode
            li Access and download attachments of a selected item 
            li Review &amp; edit details of selected records
            li Review Problem Reports related to a selected item
            li Perform markups and initate new Problem Reports for given items
            li Manage master data of single records 
            li Manage master data of multiple records in flat BOM view
        h1 Setup Instructions
        h2 Configure Items Workspace BOM View 
        p This application requires a BOM view that contains all fields required to determine the KPIs for the dashboard shown on the left hand side of the application. It is recommended to create a new BOM view named 
            strong Details 
            | for workspace 
            strong Items 
            | if it does not exist yet - with all the columns shown below. If you omit some of these columns (as they might not exist in your tenant), the given KPIs will be hidden automatically and the dashboard will still work. If you want to reuse an existing BOM view instead, you can change the view's name in the application configuration settings as described in the given chapter. 
        p List of recommended columns to match the standard KPIs:
        ul 
            li Descriptor 
            li Number
            li Lifecycle (System Field)
            li Change Pending
            li Type
            li Class Name
            li PDM Category
            li PDM Location 
            li Responsible Designer
            li Material
            li REACH
            li RoHS
            li Spare / Wear Part
            li Make or Buy
            li Lead Time
            li Long Lead Time
            li Vendor
            li Country 
            li Has Pending Packages
            li Total Cost (BOM Field)
            li Total Weight (BOM Field)
        h2 Configure Workspace Relationships  
        p Make sure that  
            strong Items  
            | can be connected to 
            strong Problem Reports 
            |as affected items. The retrieval of related PRs and also creation of new PRs will fail otherwise.
        h1 Starting the application
        p Users can access this application standalone but also in context of a given item. It can be opened in context by passing either the item number or both the wsId and dmsId. The latter capability can be used to launch the application from PLM in context of an item.
        p Opening the application from an item in PLM can be achieved in two ways: 
        ol
            li By using the framework's Chrome Extension that adds an Explorer button in the PLM item's header toolbar. 
                br
                |This option is recommneded and does not require any further configuration.
            li If the Chrome Extension cannot be used, a computed field must be added to the details page to render a button opening the Explorer. 
                br
                |See the required configuration steps below only if this option is needed.

        h2 Adding an Explorer button to Item Details page
        p If the field 
            strong DMS_ID 
            | does not exist yet in your Items workspace, add it as 
            strong Single Line Text 
            | (length 20, not visible) in tab 
            strong Item Details
            |. 
            br
            |Let this field be set upon item creation using the following script code in your item creation script: 
        p.code item.DMS_ID = dmsID;
        p In addition, add a computed field 
            strong Actions 
            | to 
            strong Item Details 
            | that renders a button to open the explorer for the current record. Use the formula shown below. In this formula, adjust the workspace ID to match your environment if needed (57 matches the standard Items workspace).
        p.code '&lt;a style="border: 1px solid #bec8d2;border-radius:3px;color: #0a131c;font-weight:600;line-height:32px;padding:4px 20px;text-align:center;text-decoration:none !important;white-space:nowrap;" target="_blank" href ="
            span.url 
            | explorer?wsId=57&amp;dmsId='||DMS_ID||'"&gt;Explorer&lt;/a&gt;'
        h1 Application Configuration Settings
        p Multiple settings can be adjusted in your custom settings file within 
            span.code exports.applications.explorer 
            |to adjust the application's behavior. In order to change any of these settings, copy the standard value from settings.js to your custom settings file in folder settings.
        h2 Core Settings
        p Review the following settings to enable startup of the explorer

            span.code supplierPackages.workspaceId

        h2 Dashboard KPI Settings
        p Parameter 
            span.code exports.applications.explorer.kpis 
            |defines the KPIs being displayed in the explorer's dashboard to the left. You may change these kpis, but keep in mind that all KPIs require you to include the given field as column to the BOM view of this application. The more fields you add, the lower the performance will be.
        p Standard KPIs are preconfigured to match the standard 
            strong Items 
            | workspace. For example, the dasboard will display counters to reveal items undergoing a change, and also display bars to indicate the PDM category:
        p.code  
            span             {
            span.indent 'id'        : 'change',
